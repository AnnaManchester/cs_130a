1. Implementation:
In this part, functionalities for a user to post on a friend’s wall are available. As for responses, no separate class is generated. Instead, they are still in the form of Wallposts, but with an extra flag indicating whether it’s a response. Each response has a post parent.
Degree of separation between two users is be found via BFS traversal. A user is also available to find all users with certain degree of separation.
A generator is written to generate fake user data. 


-------------------------
2. How to compile:
In this folder, type "make" to compile.
An executable "run" will be generated.
type "make gen” to compile fake user data generator. Type “./gen > fakedata“ to create and save a fake user data. Total number of users is set as 10000, each user has 1% chance to be friend with another user. Password for every user is set as “root”.


--------------------------
3. How to run:
An example of network user data is included in this folder, called "userdata". Type "./run userdata" to load the data and start playing.
Type "./run fakedata” for the large data.

Users can type commands to:
1. Create a user
2. Log in
3. Quit

In userdata,
There are three pre-defined users in "userdata": Leonard, Sheldon, Amy. 
Their passords are all "root".

When a user is authorized, he/she can choose the follwing operations:
1.Dis: show all posts of this user.
2.Add: add post
3.Reply: Reply to a post
4.Del: delete post
5.Save: dump user data to a file
6.Read: read user data from a file
7.Search: search users by name
8.AddFriend: add a friend by his/her username
9.ShowFriends: show current friends list
10.DeFriend: delete a friend by his/her username
11.ShowRequests: show all pending friend requests
12.Approve: approve a friend request
13.Ignore: ignore a friend request (request deleted after this)
14.PostTo: create a new post on a friend’s wall
15.ShowDist: show distance to another user
16.SearchDist: show all users with certain degree of separation
17.Quit: log out

---------------------------
4. For data format, check “fakedata".
When the contents of a user are updated, his/her current file can be dumped to a file. The entire dataset is updated before Quit.


---------------------------
5. Limitation:
Some keywords are currently used to format the data. Those keywords should not be include in wall posts.
Keywords:
USERNAME,PASSWORD,FRIEND,BIRTHDAY,REALNAME,POST_CONTENT,POST_AUTHOR,DOMAIN_NAME,RESPONSE_AUTHOR,RESPONSE_CONTENT,CREATION_TIME. 
Multiple responses can be added under one post, but replies between responses are not available.
